To add a new function to test suite
1.) Update Makefile.am. You should need to add two lines, just follow the
    examples of the existing tests.
2.) Create a reference implementation of the function. This will be in a file
    like p_sin.c in this directory. 
3.) Add a .dat file with comma separate columns. The last column contains
    the expected results
